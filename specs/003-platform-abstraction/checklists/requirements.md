# Specification Quality Checklist: Cross-Platform Infrastructure

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✓ PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Validation Date**: 2025-11-04

**Details**:
- All 16 checklist items passed on first validation
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- 4 prioritized user stories with independent test scenarios
- 24 functional requirements with clear acceptance criteria
- 10 edge cases identified
- Dependencies, assumptions, and out-of-scope items clearly documented

**Ready for next phase**: Yes - proceed with `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for technical planning
- All requirements are testable without specifying implementation approach
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes rather than technical metrics
